# Basic Java Calculator

I made this small calculator just to train my very basic object oriented programming pkills. 

It only comes with the add function for now.


To use it:
- Push the "run java" buttom
- In the terminal type the frist number and press enter
- Type the second number and press enter
- After the result you'll get this message "Deseja somar outro n√∫mero, press "s" to start again or "n" to end.
